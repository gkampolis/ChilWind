# ChilWind: Forecasting wind speeds at Chilbolton, UK.
A repository to host the data analysis required for my MSc project for Renewable Energy and Environmental Modelling at the University of Dundee. Released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/gkampolis/Chilbolton/blob/master/LICENSE.md), currently a Work in Progress. 

Data was collected by the Chilbolton Facility for Atmospheric and Radio Research (CFARR), located at Hampshire, UK. The data set is available (and continuously updated) online at the CEDA Archive [here](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bf49f0ad8afe1eff425346777c590146) and released under the Open Government Licence for public sector information, a copy of which can be found [here](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) and is also included in `.pdf` form in the data folder of this repository.

Easiest way to replicate the analysis is to open Rstudio by double-clicking the `ChilWind.Rproj` and then going through the `Main.R` script.
